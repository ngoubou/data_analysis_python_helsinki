# This exercise can give two points at maximum!

# Part 1.

# Write a function fit_line that gets one dimensional arrays x and y as parameters. The function should return the tuple (slope, intercept) of the fitted line. Write a main program that tests the fit_line function with some example arrays. The main function should produce output in the following form:

# Slope: 1.0
# Intercept: 1.16666666667

# Part 2.

# Modify your main function to plot the fitted line using matplotlib, in addition to the textual output. Plot also the original data points.
