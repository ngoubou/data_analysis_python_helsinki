# Merge the processed cycling data set (from the previous exercise) and weather data set along the columns year, month, and day. 
# Note that the names of these columns might be different in the two tables: use the left_on and right_on parameters. 
# Then drop useless columns 'm', 'd', 'Time', and 'Time zone'.

# Write function cycling_weather that reads the data sets and returns the resulting DataFrame.
