# In the above plot the x coordinates were implicitly set to the indices of the array a, that is, 
# arange(10). Find out from the documentation of plt.plot how to specify the x coordinates explicitly. 
# Find out also how to draw multiple graphs in one axes.

# Make your main function plot the following two graphs in one axes. 
# The first graphs has x coordinates 2,4,6,7 and y coordinates 4,3,5,1. 
# The second graph has x coordinates 1,2,3,4 and y coordinates 4,2,3,1.

# Add also a title and some labels for x axis and y axis. 
# Note that in the non-interactive mode you have to call plt.show() for the figure to show.

# The plot should look like the one below.
