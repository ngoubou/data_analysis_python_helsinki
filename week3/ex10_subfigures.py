# Write function subfigures that creates a figure that has two subfigures 
# (two axes in matplotlib parlance). 
# The function gets a two dimensional array a as a parameter. 
# In the left subfigure draw using the plot method a graph, 
# whose x coordinates are in the first column of a and the y coordinates are in the second column of a. 
# In the right subfigure draw using the scatter method a set of points whose x coords are again 
# in the first column of a and whose y coordinates are in the second column of a. 
# Additionally, the points should get their color from the third column of a, and size of the point
# from the fourth column of a. For this, use the c and s named parameters of scatter, respectively

# Test your function subfigure from the main function.
