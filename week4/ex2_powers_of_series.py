# Make function powers_of_series that takes a Series and a positive integer k as parameters and returns a DataFrame. 
# The resulting DataFrame should have the same index as the input Series. 
# The first column of the dataFrame should be the input Series, the second column should contain the Series raised to power of two. 
# The third column should contain the Series raised to the power of three, and so on until (and including) power of k. 
# The columns should have indices from 1 to k.

# The values should be numbers, but the index can have any type. Test your function from the main function. 
# Example of usage:


# Should print:

#    1   2   3
# a  1   1   1
# b  2   4   8
# c  3   9  27
# d  4  16  64
