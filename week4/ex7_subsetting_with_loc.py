# Write function subsetting_with_loc that in one go takes the subset of municipalities from Akaa to Äänekoski and restricts it to columns: 
# "Population", "Share of Swedish-speakers of the population, %", and "Share of foreign citizens of the population, %". 
# The function should return this content as a DataFrame. Use the attribute loc.
