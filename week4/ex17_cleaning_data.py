# Note, you must do the edits programmatically using the string edit methods, not by creating a new DataFrame by hand.
# The columns should have dtypes object, integer, float, integer, object. 
# The where method of DataFrames can be helpful, likewise the string methods of Series objects. 
# You get an additional point, if you manage to get the columns President and Vice-president right!
