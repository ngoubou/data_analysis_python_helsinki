# In the main function load a data set of municipal information from the src folder (originally from Statistics Finland). 
# Use the function pd.read_csv, and note that the separator is a tabulator.

# Print the shape of the DataFrame (number of rows and columns) and the column names in the following format:

# Shape: r,c
# Columns:
# col1 
# col2
# ...

# Note, sometimes file ending tsv (tab separated values) is used instead of csv if the separator is a tab.
