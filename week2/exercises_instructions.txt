### EXERCISE 1 (integers in brackets)

Write function integers_in_brackets that finds from a given string all integers that are enclosed in brackets.

Example run: integers_in_brackets(" afd [asd] [12 ] [a34] [ -43 ]tt [+12]xxx") returns [12, -43, 12]. So there can be whitespace between the number and the brackets, but no other character besides those that make up the integer.

Test your function from the main function.



### EXERCISE 2 (file listing)

The file src/listing.txt contains a list of files with one line per file. Each line contains seven fields: access rights, number of references, owner's name, name of owning group, file size, date, filename. These fields are separated with one or more spaces. Note that there may be spaces also within these seven fields.

Write function file_listing that loads the file src/listing.txt. It should return a list of tuples (size, month, day, hour, minute, filename). Use regular expressions to do this (either match, search, findall, or finditer method).

An example: for line

-rw-r--r-- 1 jttoivon hyad-all   25399 Nov  2 21:25 exception_hierarchy.pdf

the function should create the tuple (25399, "Nov", 2, 21, 25, "exception_hierarchy.pdf").



### EXERCISE 3 (red green blue)

The file src/rgb.txt contains names of colors and their numerical representations in RGB format. The RBG format allows a color to be represented as a mixture of red, green, and blue components. Each component can have an integer value in the range [0,255]. Each line in the file contains four fields: red, green, blue, and colorname. Each field is separated by some amount of whitespace (tab or space in this case). The text file is formatted to make it print nicely, but that makes it harder to process by a computer. Note that some color names can also contain a space character.

Write function red_green_blue that reads the file rgb.txt from the folder src. Remove the irrelevant first line of the file. The function should return a list of strings. Clean-up the file so that the strings in the returned list have four fields separated by a single tab character (\t). Use regular expressions to do this.

The first string in the returned list should be:

'255\t250\t250\tsnow'



#### EXERCISE 4 (word frequencies)

Create function word_frequencies that gets a filename as a parameter and returns a dict with the word frequencies. In the dictionary the keys are the words and the corresponding values are the number of times that word occurred in the file specified by the function parameter. Read all the lines from the file and split the lines into words using the split() method. Further, remove punctuation from the ends of words using the strip("""!"#$%&'()*,-./:;?@[]_""") method call.

Test this function in the main function using the file alice.txt. In the output, there should be a word and its count per line separated by a tab:

The     64
Project 83
Gutenberg   26
EBook   3
of      303



### EXERCISE 5 (summary)

This exercise can give two points at maximum!

Part 1.

Create a function called summary that gets a filename as a parameter. The input file should contain a floating point number on each line of the file. Make your function read these numbers and then return a triple containing the sum, average, and standard deviation of these numbers for the file. As a reminder, the formula for corrected sample standard deviation is ∑i=1n(xi−x‾)2n−1\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline x)^2}{n-1}}n−1∑i=1n​(xi​−x)2​

​, where x‾\overline xx is the average.

The main function should call the function summary for each filename in the list sys.argv[1:] of command line parameters. (Skip sys.argv[0] since it contains the name of the current program.)

Example of usage from the command line: python3 src/summary.py src/example.txt src/example2.txt

Print floating point numbers using six decimals precision. The output should look like this:

File: src/example.txt Sum: 51.400000 Average: 10.280000 Stddev: 8.904606
File: src/example2.txt Sum: 5446.200000 Average: 1815.400000 Stddev: 3124.294045

Part 2.

If some line doesn’t represent a number, you can just ignore that line. You can achieve this with the try-except block. An example of recovering from an exceptional situation:

try:
    x = float(line)           # The float constructor raises ValueError exception if conversion is no possible
except ValueError:
    # Statements in here are executed when the above conversion fails

We will cover more about exceptions later in the course.



### EXERCISE 6 (file count)

This exercise can give two points at maximum!

Part 1.

Create a function file_count that gets a filename as parameter and returns a triple of numbers. The function should read the file, count the number of lines, words, and characters in the file, and return a triple with these count in this order. You get division into words by splitting at whitespace. You don't have to remove punctuation.

Part 2.

Create a main function that in a loop calls file_count using each filename in the list of command line parameters sys.argv[1:] as a parameter, in turn. For call python3 src/file_count file1 file2 ... the output should be

?      ?       ?       file1
?      ?       ?       file2
...

The fields are separated by tabs (\t). The fields are in order: linecount, wordcount, charactercount, filename.



### EXERCISE 7 (file extensions)

This exercise can give two points at maximum!

Part 1.

Write function file_extensions that gets as a parameter a filename. It should read through the lines from this file. Each line contains a filename. Find the extension for each filename. The function should return a pair, where the first element is a list containing all filenames with no extension (with the preceding period (.) removed). The second element of the pair is a dictionary with extensions as keys and corresponding values are lists with filenames having that extension.

Sounds a bit complicated, but hopefully the next example will clarify this. If the file contains the following lines

file1.txt
mydocument.pdf
file2.txt
archive.tar.gz
test

then the return value should be the pair: (["test"], { "txt" : ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"], "pdf" : ["mydocument.pdf"], "gz" : ["archive.tar.gz"] } )

Part 2.

Write a main method that calls the file_extensions function with "src/filenames.txt" as the argument. Then print the results so that for each extension there is a line consisting of the extension and the number of files with that extension. The first line of the output should give the number of files without extensions.

With the example in part 1, the output should be

1 files with no extension
gz 1
pdf 1
txt 2

Had there been no filenames without extension then the first line would have been 0 files with no extension. In the printout list the extensions in alphabetical order. 



### EXERCISE 8 (prepend)

Create a class called Prepend. We create an instance of the class by giving a string as a parameter to the initializer. The initializer stores the parameter in an instance attribute start. The class also has a method write(s) which prints the string s prepended with the start string. An example of usage:

p = Prepend("+++ ")
p.write("Hello");

Will print

+++ Hello

Try out using the class from the main function.



### EXERCISE 9 (rational)

Create a class Rational whose instances are rational numbers. A new rational number can be created with the call to the class. For example, the call r=Rational(1,4) creates a rational number “one quarter”. Make the instances support the following operations: + - * / < > == with their natural behaviour. Make the rationals also printable so that from the printout we can clearly see that they are rational numbers.


### EXERCISE 10 (extract numbers)

Write a function extract_numbers that gets a string as a parameter. It should return a list of numbers that can be both ints and floats. Split the string to words at whitespace using the split() method. Then iterate through each word, and initially try to convert to an int. If unsuccesful, then try to convert to a float. If not a number then skip the word.

Example run: print(extract_numbers("abd 123 1.2 test 13.2 -1")) will return [123, 1.2, 13.2, -1]



### EXERCISE 11 (rows and columns)

Write two functions, get_rows and get_columns, that get a two dimensional array as parameter. They should return the list of rows and columns of the array, respectively. The rows and columns should be one dimensional arrays. You may use the transpose operation, which flips rows to columns, in your solution. The transpose is done by the T method:

a=np.random.randint(0, 10, (4,4))
print(a)
print(a.T)

[[0 1 9 9]
[0 4 7 3]
[2 7 2 0]
[0 4 5 5]]
[[0 0 2 0]
[1 4 7 4]
[9 7 2 5]
[9 3 0 5]]

Test your solution in the main function. Example of usage:

a = np.array([[5, 0, 3, 3],
 [7, 9, 3, 5],
 [2, 4, 7, 6],
 [8, 8, 1, 6]])
get_rows(a)
[array([5, 0, 3, 3]), array([7, 9, 3, 5]), array([2, 4, 7, 6]), array([8, 8, 1, 6])]
get_columns(a)
[array([5, 7, 2, 8]), array([0, 9, 4, 8]), array([3, 3, 7, 1]), array([3, 5, 6, 6]



### EXERCISE 12 (row and column vectors)

Create function get_row_vectors that returns a list of rows from the input array of shape (n,m), but this time the rows must have shape (1,m). Similarly, create function get_columns_vectors that returns a list of columns (each having shape (n,1)) of the input matrix .

Example: for a 2x3 input matrix

 [[5 0 3]
  [3 7 9]]

the result should be

Row vectors: 
[array([[5, 0, 3]]), array([[3, 7, 9]])]
Column vectors: 
[array([[5],
        [3]]), 
 array([[0],
        [7]]), 
 array([[3],
        [9]])]

The above output is basically just the returned lists printed with print. Only some whitespace is adjusted to make it look nicer. Output is not tested.



### EXERCISE 13 (diamond)

Create a function diamond that returns a two dimensional integer array where the 1s form a diamond shape. Rest of the numbers are 0. The function should get a parameter that tells the length of a side of the diamond. Do this using the eye and concatenate functions of NumPy and array slicing.

Example of usage:

print(diamond(3))
[[0 0 1 0 0]
 [0 1 0 1 0]
 [1 0 0 0 1]
 [0 1 0 1 0]
 [0 0 1 0 0]]
print(diamond(1))
[[1]]



### EXERCISE 14 (vector lengths)

Write function vector_lengths that gets a two dimensional array of shape (n,m) as a parameter. Each row in this array corresponds to a vector. The function should return an array of shape (n,), that has the length of each vector in the input. The length is defined by the usual Euclidean norm. Don't use loops at all in your solution. Instead use vectorized operations. You must use at least the np.sum and the np.sqrt functions. You can't use the function scipy.linalg.norm. Test your function in the main function.



### EXERCISE 15 (vector angles)

Let x and y be m-dimensional vectors. The angle α\alphaα between two vectors is defined by the equation cos⁡xy(α):=⟨x,y⟩∣∣x∣∣∣∣y∣∣\cos_{xy}(\alpha):=\frac{\langle x,y\rangle}{||x|| ||y||}cosxy​(α):=∣∣x∣∣∣∣y∣∣⟨x,y⟩​, where the angle brackets denote the inner product, and ∣∣x∣∣:=⟨x,x⟩||x||:=\sqrt{\langle x,x \rangle}∣∣x∣∣:=⟨x,x⟩​.

Write function vector_angles that gets two arrays X and Y with same shape (n,m) as parameters. Each row in the arrays corresponds to a vector. The function should return vector of shape (n,) with the corresponding angles between vectors of X and Y in degrees, not in radians. Again, don't use loops, but use vectorized operations.

Note: function np.arccos is only defined on the domain [-1.0,1.0]. If you try to compute np.arccos(1.000000001), it will fail. These kind of errors can occur due to use of finite precision in numerical computations. Force the argument to be in the correct range (clip method).

Test your solution in the main program.



### EXERCISE 16 multiplication table revisited)

Write function multiplication_table that gets a positive integer n as parameter. The function should return an array with shape (n,n). The element at index (i,j) should be i*j. Don't use for loops! In your solution, rely on broadcasting, the np.arange function, reshaping and vectorized operators. Example of usage:

print(multiplication_table(4))
[[0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 2 3]
 [0 2 4 6]
 [0 3 6 9]]
