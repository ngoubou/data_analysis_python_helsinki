# Write function integers_in_brackets that finds from a given string all integers
# that are enclosed in brackets.

# Example run: integers_in_brackets(" afd [asd] [12 ] [a34] [ -43 ]tt [+12]xxx") returns [12, -43, 12]. 
# So there can be whitespace between the number and the brackets, 
# but no other character besides those that make up the integer.

# Test your function from the main function.
