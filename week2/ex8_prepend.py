# Create a class called Prepend. We create an instance of the class by giving a string as a parameter
# to the initializer. The initializer stores the parameter in an instance attribute start. 
# The class also has a method write(s) which prints the string s prepended with the start string. 
# An example of usage:

# p = Prepend("+++ ")
#p.write("Hello");

# Will print

# +++ Hello

# Try out using the class from the main function.
