# Write function interleave that gets arbitrary number of lists as parameters. 
# You may assume that all the lists have equal length. 
# The function should return one list containing all the elements from the input lists interleaved. 
# Test your function from the main function of the program.

# Example: interleave([1,2,3], [20,30,40], ['a', 'b', 'c']) should return [1, 20, 'a', 2, 30, 'b', 3, 40, 'c'].
#  Use the zip function to implement interleave. Remember the extend method of list objects.
