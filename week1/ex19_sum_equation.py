# Write a function sum_equation which takes a list of positive integers as parameters and returns a string
# with an equation of the sum of the elements.

# Example: sum_equation([1,5,7]) returns "1 + 5 + 7 = 13" Observe, the spaces should be exactly as shown above.
# For an empty list the function should return the string "0 = 0".
